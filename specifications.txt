In an instance with edge type EUC_2D, all vertex have edges to every other vertex. In this way, to build the graph:
    - traverse the file, adding all nodes with their coordinates
    - traverse the nodes, adding edges for every other vertex
        - to calculate the distance between two vertex i and j, use the euclidian distance formula:
            xd = x[i] - x[j];
            yd = y[i] - y[j];
            dij = nint( sqrt( xd*xd + yd*yd) );

            nint(x) = (int) (x+0.5)
